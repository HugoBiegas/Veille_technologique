Traditional approaches often rely on predefined validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output similarity.

In this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning.
