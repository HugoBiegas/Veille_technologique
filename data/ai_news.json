      "description": "A stealth artificial intelligence startup founded by an MIT researcher emerged this morning with an ambitious claim: its new AI model can control computers better than systems built by OpenAI and Anthropic — at a fraction of the cost.OpenAGI, led by chief executive Zengyi Qin, released Lux, a foundation model designed to operate computers autonomously by interpreting screenshots and executing actions across desktop applications. The San Francisco-based company says Lux achieves an 83.6 percent s",

PARC is built on a hierarchical multi-agent architecture incorporating task planning, execution, and a mechanism that evaluates its own actions and their outcomes from an independent context and provides feedback, namely self-assessment and self-feedback. This design enables PARC to detect and correct high-level strategic errors and sustai",
