To tap into that niche — and make it practical at scale — the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) introduced Bolmo, a new family of models that leverage its Olmo 3 models by “bytefiying” them and reusing their backbone and capabilities. The company launched two versions, Bolmo 7B and Bolmo 1B, which are “the first fully open byte-level lang",

Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during",

Unlike traditional methods, this algorithm is not based on temporal difference (TD) learning (which has scalability challenges), and scales well to long-horizon tasks. We can do Reinforcement Learning (RL) based on divide and conquer, instead of temporal difference (TD) learning. Problem setting: off-policy RL Our problem setting is off-policy RL.
