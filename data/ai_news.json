      "description": "AI engineers often chase performance by scaling up LLM parameters and data, but the trend toward smaller, more efficient, and better-focused models has accelerated. The Phi-4 fine-tuning methodology is the cleanest public example of a training approach that smaller enterprise teams can copy. It shows how a carefully chosen dataset and fine-tuning strategy can make a 14B model compete with much larger ones.The Phi-4 model was trained on just 1.4 million carefully chosen prompt-response pairs.
