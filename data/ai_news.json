      "description": "In this tutorial, we demonstrate how we simulate a privacy-preserving fraud detection system using Federated Learning without relying on heavyweight frameworks or complex infrastructure. We build a clean, CPU-friendly setup that mimics ten independent banks, each training a local fraud-detection model on its own highly imbalanced transaction data. We coordinate these local updates through a [&#8230;] The post A Coding Implementation of an OpenAI-Assisted Privacy-Preserving Federated Fraud Detect",

Prompt injection attack is listed as the #1 threat by OWASP to LLM-integrated applications, where an LLM input contains a trusted prompt (instruction) and an untrusted data. The data may contain injected instructions to arbitrarily manipulate the LLM. As an example, to unfairly promote “Restaurant A”, its owner could use prompt injection t",

For example, dermatology conditions are diverse in their appearance and severity and manifest differently across skin tones. Yet, existing dermatology image datasets often lack representation of everyday conditions (like rashes, allergies and infections) and skew towards lighter skin tones. Fu",
