      "description": "For three decades, the web has been designed with one audience in mind: People. Pages are optimized for human eyes, clicks and intuition. But as AI-driven agents begin to browse on our behalf, the human-first assumptions built into the internet are being exposed as fragile.The rise of agentic browsing — where a browser doesn’t just show pages but takes action — marks the beginning of this shift. Tools like Perplexity’s Comet and Anthropic’s Claude browser plugin already attempt to execute user i",
