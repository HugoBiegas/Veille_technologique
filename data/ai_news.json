Starting from a binary dataset, we explore why linear regression struggles as a classifier, how the logistic function fixes these issues, and how log-loss naturally appears from the likelihood. With a transparent gradient-descent table, you can watch the model learn at each iteration—making the whole process intuitive, visual, and surprisingly satisfying.
