Firecrawl introduced a native integration with Lovable. The idea is simple but powerful: Firecrawl handles the hard problem of turning the web into clean, LLM-ready data, while Lovable handles everything else—UI, app logic, and deployment. With this integration, Lovable users can connect directly to Firecrawl’s APIs and build web-",

By adding one extra output to a model, the system learns to flag such odd items as outliers, instead of quietly giving the wrong result. Simple statistical checks",
