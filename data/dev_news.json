That model worked when apps were predictable. But modern products especially AI-powered ones aren’t predictable anymore. Quietly, Flutter has been adapting to this reality. Not with",

The issue isn’t that developers don’t know how to use AI. It’s that most are using it at the wrong level of abstraction. That’s the real problem, and it explains almost every misuse we’re seeing today. The Surface-Level Use Case Trap Most developers use generative AI as a faster Google.

      "description": "Most investors agree that technical due diligence is important. Yet in many deals, it still happens after the term sheet is signed, when momentum is high, timelines are tight, and walking away suddenly feels expensive.

Whether it’s hyper-realistic portraits or strange backgrounds that don’t quite make sense, spotting AI images by eye is getting harder. So I decided to try out some AI image detectors to see which ones actually work—and surprisingly, one of the best wasn’t even built just for images. 🧪 Th",

      "description": "If you’re a founder planning a mobile app in Michigan, the first serious question is cost. Not theoretical cost. Not “average U.S. rates.” What you will actually pay in 2026 once scope, talent, and delivery reality collide. Michigan sits in a middle zone. It is not Silicon Valley expensive. It is not offshore cheap. That middle ground creates both opportunity and confusion for founders who have never built software before—or who were burned once already. This guide is written for founders and op",
