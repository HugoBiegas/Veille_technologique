It introduced the concept of dynamic auto-configuration, abandoned cumbersome XML configuration, and fully leveraged Java’s built-in annotations and the ServiceLoader mechanism, greatly reducing the number of configuration decisions required in typical business development, thereby reshaping how Java applications are developed and deployed. However, as time has gone on, SpringBoot has grown old. The accumulated adverse effects of ",

      "description": "by Alessio Pelliccione Some days ago at work, I was writing a small dynamic script to trigger a build for a single file. While doing that, I suddenly wondered: how do modern build tools actually work under the hood? That question led me to start building a minimal engine — something simple enough to grasp the core idea, but realistic enough to mirror how tools like esbuild or Vite handle rebuilds internally, deciding what to rebuild. Let’s see the process step by step — from file watching to dep",
