While this characteristic allows for greater program efficiency, it also introduces risks such as memory leaks and incorrect dea",

      "description": "When every Pod screams for CPU and memory, who decides who lives, who waits, and who gets evicted? Kubernetes isn't just a scheduler — it's a negotiator of fairness and efficiency. Every second, it balances hundreds of workloads, deciding what runs, what waits, and what gets terminated — while maintaining reliability and cost efficiency. This article unpacks how Quality of Service (QoS), Priority Classes, Preemption, and Bin-Packing Scoring come together to keep your cluster stable and fair. ⚙️ ",

So I started experimenting with self-correcting LLMs—essentially, letting the model generate a draft, detect likely mistakes, suggest fixes, and then pick the best version. At first, I thought it would be simple. Spoiler: it wasn’t. ",
