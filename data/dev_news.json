However, when validation fails, the error messages still use the original object property names, ignoring the configured naming strategy, which leads to inconsistent API responses.

As a result, validation errors report the Java field names rather",

Your coding partner today isn’t just a team member on Zoom—it’s an AI assistant that already understands the project’s architecture, knows the quirks in your codebase, and can suggest optimizations before you even type a single line. It’s not science fiction—it’s a near-future reality that developers are starting to glimpse today. This scenario may sound intimidating to some. Are",

Here, one class can inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class. This is one of the fundamental concept in OOPs. A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class. To inherit from a class, we use the extend keyword.

This is where linguistic knowledge comes into play — the set of rules, structures, and meanings humans use to communicate coherently. For decades, NLP was grounded in traditional linguistics. Early systems relied on grammars, parsers, and syntactic rules, reflecting a structured understand",
