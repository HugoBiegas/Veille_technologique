      "description": "React 19 is on the horizon, and many of us are looking for ways to simplify state management without sacrificing performance or type safety. If you’ve been frustrated by heavy boilerplate or global stores that trigger unnecessary re-renders, react‑state‑custom may be the lightweight alternative you’ve been waiting for. Why another state library? Many popular solutions rely on reducers and dispatch functions, introducing patterns that feel disconnected from the rest of your React code. React‑stat",

But why should you separate them? Why not just expose your JPA entities directly through your API? The short answer: maintainability, security, and performance. Maintainability: DTOs decouple your API layer from the database schema, giving you flexibility to change on",
