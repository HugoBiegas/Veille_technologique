The setup was straightforward enough: I had a RHEL 9 server that needed to communicate with an older Windows server—nothing exotic. But this wasn’t just a lab test. It was a production-adjacent environment with real limitations, and no, upgrading the Windows box wasn’t an option (more on that in a minute). As a recovering Linux snob, I’",
