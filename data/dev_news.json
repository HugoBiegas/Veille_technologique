That assumption holds up at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). But when noise levels rise — below 0 dB SNR — it falls apart. Even if the magnitude is estimated pe",

Sites greet you with a popover that demands assent to their cookie policy, and leave you with Taboola ads promising “One Weird Trick!” to cure your ailments. Social media sites are tuned for engagement, and few things are more engaging than a fight. Today it seems that people want to quarrel; I have seen flame wars among birders.   These tensions are often at odds with a site’s goals. If we are providing support and advice to customers, we don’t want t",

Financial products, which is the field I work in, are no exception. With people’s real hard-earned money on the line, user expectations running high, and a crowded market, it's tempting to throw as many features at the wall as possible and hope something sticks.
