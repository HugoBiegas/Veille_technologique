This process has been present throughout history, especially in warfare, and dates back to thousands of years in the past.

Scientists discovered a clever trick that lets modern AI models, the same kind that power chatbots, handle brand‑new problems without extra training. By giving the model a hidden “scratch‑pad” to work on, it can break down a tough question into tiny steps, check its own work, and even correct mistakes on the fly—much like a student using a notebook to solve a math problem they’ve never practi",
