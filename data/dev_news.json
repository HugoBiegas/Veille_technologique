We're Wen and Tobias, and we're building Metorial (https://metorial.com), an integration platform that connects AI agents to external tools and data using MCP.The Problem: While MCP works great locally (e.g., Cursor or Claude Desktop), server-side deployments are painful. Running MCP servers means managing Docker configs, per-user OAuth flows, scaling concurrent sessions, and building observability from scratch.
