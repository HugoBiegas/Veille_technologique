      "description": "Ever wondered how computer scientists analyze algorithms without worrying about whether you're running on an M1 Mac, an Intel server, or a Raspberry Pi? The answer lies in the Random Access Machine (RAM) model—a theoretical framework that abstracts away hardware details while still giving us accurate predictions about algorithm performance. What is the RAM Model? The Random Access Machine is an idealized model of how computers work. Think of it as a simplified blueprint that captures the essenti",
