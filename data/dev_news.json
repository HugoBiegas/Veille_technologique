But as systems scale—more services, more teams, more releases—those early wins can quickly turn into slow pipelines, flaky tests, and brittle automation that no one fully trusts. Maintaining test automation at scale is not about writing more tests. It’s about designing systems that can evolve without collapsing under their own weight.

Codebases do not break down due to a specific problem; they are drifting due to small changes (such as importing for analytics tracking) that become significant over time from a maintenance standpoint. You will not discover these issues with ESLint or unit tests. The long-term result is that after 6 months, you will be scared to touch anything in your codebase.
