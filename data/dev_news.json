And honestly? That’s the beauty of it. Serverless is essentially a collection of endpoints and functions, each performing a single task. Unlike uploading a full-stack application on Lambda, you upload functions that act as endpoints. These endpoints can then be consumed on your frontend, just like any other regular REST API. ",

      "description": "AI is growing fast, and 2026 is set to be an even bigger year for real world AI adoption. But with this growth comes a quiet problem that many teams are not prepared for. It is not model accuracy. It is not GPU access. It is the basic data workflow that keeps everything moving. Most teams feel this pressure already, but the gap will be wider in 2026. More apps, more data, more formats and more AI steps means more points of failure. Even a small delay or mismatch in data will slow down the entire",
