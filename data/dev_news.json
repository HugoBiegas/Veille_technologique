This can lead to performance issues, especially in complex applications. One way to prevent this is by using React.memo(), which helps memoize a component. This means React will only re-render the component if its props have changed. In this example, let’s assume we can't move the count state to a separate component because it's needed in the parent App component.",

By adding one extra output to a model, the system learns to flag such odd items as outliers, instead of quietly giving the wrong result. Simple statistical checks",
