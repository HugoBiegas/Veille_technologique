      "description": "SpringBoot is a major leap forward built on the Spring framework. It introduced the concept of dynamic auto-configuration, abandoned cumbersome XML configuration, and fully leveraged Java’s built-in annotations and the ServiceLoader mechanism, greatly reducing the number of configuration decisions required in typical business development, thereby reshaping how Java applications are developed and deployed. However, as time has gone on, SpringBoot has grown old. The accumulated adverse effects of ",

During playback, it outputs low level (0 V); when idle, it should output 3.3 V. However, after 5 seconds of inactivity, the chip automatically enters a 2 μA ultra-low-power mode — in this state, the BUSY pin becomes high-impedance. Consequently, the measured voltage drops to around 0.2 V, which is expected and not a fault. ⚡ Key Behavior Explanation Normal Opera",
