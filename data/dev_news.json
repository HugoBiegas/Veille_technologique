They tell you your WPM, maybe your accuracy, and then… that’s it. I never really felt like I was improving. At some point, I realized that most typing tools are great at measuring performance, but not very good at helping you get better. They reset everything after each test, even though the mistakes I made were usually the same ones. That observation pushed me to think differently",

Teams know they are using AI features, ticket summarisation, content generation, analytics assistants, but often lack a clear, end-to-end view of how data flows across systems once these features are enabled.

      "description": "What Is Table Bloat? Table bloat in PostgreSQL refers to the phenomenon where \"dead tuples\" generated by UPDATE or DELETE operations remain uncollected by VACUUM, causing data files to grow unnecessarily large. For VACUUM to reclaim dead tuples, it must be guaranteed that those tuples \"cannot possibly be referenced by any currently running transaction.\" If old transactions persist for any reason, VACUUM's garbage collection stops at that point. This article explains the following four causes of ",
