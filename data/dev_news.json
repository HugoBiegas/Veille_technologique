So I’m sharing some of my research for anyone who’s either facing the same decision, wants some insight into what I discovered, or wants to share their input. Initially, I wanted to go with WebFlux because every blog I read and everyone I talked to was talking about its non-blocking I/O. For people who aren’t familiar with reactive libraries, here’s how I looked at it. Imagine crea",
