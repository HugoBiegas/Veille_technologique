The ones who stalk the edges of every system. The ones who cultivate an obsession so sharp it becomes a weapon. I never intended to walk that path. I just",

      "description": "Erase and Rewind: Surgically Removing Bias from AI Models Imagine your groundbreaking AI, trained on a massive dataset, suddenly exhibits unwanted biases – perhaps discriminating against a specific demographic. Retraining from scratch is a time-consuming and expensive nightmare. But what if you could surgically remove the problematic data's influence, leaving the rest of your model intact? The key is understanding how that specific data subtly warped the model's learning landscape. Geometric-Dis",
