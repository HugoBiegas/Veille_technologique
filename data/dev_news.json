It provides a fully serverless runtime, no Docker builds, no ECR pushes, no ECS or Kubernetes setup, so agents can be deployed and scaled with minimal operational overhead. It’s framework-agnostic. You can run agents built with Bedrock Agents, AWS Strands, LangChain/LangGraph, OpenAI's Agent SDK, CrewAI, or any other agent framework. Strands gets first-class integration",

The answer to all of these questions is cognitive architecture. Cognitive architecture is the foundation behind cognitive agents. AI systems that don’t just generate o",

In this post, we’ll break down Agentic AI from first principles — ",

Quantization is when we store and compute those weights using fewer bits. For example: FP16 – 16 bits INT8 – 8 bits INT4 – 4 bits INT2 – 2 bits So if we take a number like: 0.12345678 (32-bit float) We can approximate it to: 0.12 (8-bit/4-bit) Ollama quantization formats Now let's understand how to read a model name and understan",

Il Load Balancing è una funzione chiave di un reverse proxy, che distribuisce il traffico per evitare che un singolo server venga sovraccaricato. Nei sistemi moderni, Cloud Load Balancer e Reverse Proxy lavorano insieme: il primo gestisce il traffico esterno, ",

Computers can do that too with a method called multi-task learning, where one system learns several jobs together. When tasks share hints they build shared knowledge so the main job often gets better results even with less data. This also can make training go faster, because the system uses the same lessons for more",

Mipmaps are generated so that far textures can sample higher mip levels, which means a more pleasant visual output and cheaper sampling. Wikipedia has a very nice example of that phenomenon, as well as the OpenGL GitBook. The downside is that we need to use more memory: Why use it? Most of the time we don't render textures with ",
