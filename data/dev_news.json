      "description": "Introduction: Why Backpropagation Matters Backpropagation is the learning engine behind modern deep learning. Every time a neural network improves its predictions — from recognizing faces to generating text — the improvement comes from one mechanism: adjusting weights using gradients, and those gradients are computed through backpropagation. Why this matters: A neural network is essentially a giant parametric function with millions or billions of weights. Backpropagation provides an efficient wa",

      "description": "Most investors agree that technical due diligence is important. Yet in many deals, it still happens after the term sheet is signed, when momentum is high, timelines are tight, and walking away suddenly feels expensive. At Dextralabs, we see this play out repeatedly. By the time serious technical issues surface, leverage has shifted, negotiations become awkward, and what should have been a confident decision turns into damage control. This article explains why starting technical due diligence bef",

Whether it’s hyper-realistic portraits or strange backgrounds that don’t quite make sense, spotting AI images by eye is getting harder. So I decided to try out some AI image detectors to see which ones actually work—and surprisingly, one of the best wasn’t even built just for images. 🧪 Th",

      "description": "If you’re a founder planning a mobile app in Michigan, the first serious question is cost. Not theoretical cost. Not “average U.S. rates.” What you will actually pay in 2026 once scope, talent, and delivery reality collide. Michigan sits in a middle zone. It is not Silicon Valley expensive. It is not offshore cheap. That middle ground creates both opportunity and confusion for founders who have never built software before—or who were burned once already. This guide is written for founders and op",

I noted it was struggling with a React/TypeScript project. When running yarn commands it wasn't honoring the .nvmrc file, so it didn't load the correct node version. This caused issues for files generated/built against different NodeJS versions. My setup is slightly strange: because NVM takes a while to load, and I'm impatient, I don't load it automatically i",
