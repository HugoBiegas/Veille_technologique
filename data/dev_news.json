      "description": "Hi Community! 👋 Recently, I’ve been experimenting with building advanced skills for Claude Code / OpenCode to automate complex creative workflows—specifically, writing movie scripts, generating assets, and creating long-shot videos. These skills define complex workflows that trigger local models for image and video generation. The idea was simple: if a workflow fails, the system should try alternative commands until it succeeds. However, I noticed that Claude Code / OpenCode doesn't always relia",

Their stance is that AI is flooding the industry with low-quality software, and we’re all going to pay for it later in outages, regressions, and technical debt. This argument sounds convincing until you look honestly at how software has actually been built for the last 20 years. The uncomfortable truth is that “slop” didn’t start with AI.

      "description": "Documentation tools are often evaluated based on features, flexibility, or how “developer-friendly” they feel. But one critical factor is frequently underestimated: learning curve. A high learning curve is not just a personal inconvenience. For growing teams, it becomes an organizational tax paid in time, misalignment, and slow knowledge flow. This cost is especially visible when documentation is no longer owned by developers alone, but shared across support, product, QA, and operations teams. D",

      "description": "Adding Redis caching to a Django application often looks like an easy win: a slow endpoint, a Redis instance, and suddenly response times drop from seconds to milliseconds. Django and django-redis make the mechanics straightforward enough that a junior engineer can ship a working cache in a day. The danger is that caching feels solved once it works. In reality, Redis only accelerates the decisions you’ve already made — good or bad. Correctness, security, invalidation, and concurrency are still y",

For me, that started with a simple question: “Can I let my AI actually see and manage my calendar?” That’s exactly what mcp-caldav does.
