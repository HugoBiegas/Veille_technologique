Tickets were only around $40 per person, which is definitely on the cheaper side for conferences, and I understand that running an event is hard. Things happen. Hiccups are normal. But this conference had every type of hiccup. I think I saw the entire bingo card. 🔥 Chaos Outside the Venue The event took place at the Sheraton in downtown Toronto. Before",
