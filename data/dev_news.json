That maturity has changed what good Node.js API design looks like. The basics still matter, but expectations are higher: better performance, better safety, better developer experience, and fewer footguns. These are the practices I’ve found most valuable when building and maintaining Node.js APIs today. Treat the runtime as a constraint, not a given Modern N",

It runs over HTTP/2 and uses Protocol Buffers for compact serialization.

      "description": "Hey Dev Community! I’m glad you’re here — buckle up. Below is a complete, runnable, production‑oriented example of a tiny language called Falcon with full source code (C++17) for a lexer, parser, AST, semantic pass, LLVM codegen, and an ORC JIT runner. Paste this into a repo, follow the build steps, and you’ll have a working compiler that compiles a tiny program and runs it. I’ll keep it serious and professional — and yes, I’ll sprinkle a little humor so you don’t fall asleep while we bend LLVM ",

Here's the thing—changing an OS in a virtual machine is way easier than doing it on physical hardware.
