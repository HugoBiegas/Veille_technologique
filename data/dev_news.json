Instead of calling Scapy or hiding behind Python abstractions, I decided to build my own packet manipulation library from scratch in Nim. That became NimPacket, and it turned out to be one of the most useful and eye opening projects I have done. NimPacket gives full control of IPv4, TCP, UDP, and ICMP headers. Everything",

In plain terms: Pick two images Blend them pixel-by-pixel Blend their labels too The resulting image looks surreal, but it works. Why does pixel-blending help?
