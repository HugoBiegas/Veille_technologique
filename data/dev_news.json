The trick is balancing speed with freshness: you want returning users to load instantly, but you also need them to get new code right after you deploy. This guide explains a proven, low-maintenance caching strategy you can adopt for any modern web app. What browser caching is A browser stores copies of files it downloads",

A single NVIDIA A100 can cost $10,000+, and in a Kubernetes cluster running AI workloads, you might have dozens of them. Here's the uncomfortable truth: most of the time, they're sitting idle. If you're struggling with GPU scheduling in Kubernetes or looking for ways to reclaim idle GPUs, you're not alone. A data scientist spins up a training job, requests 4 GPUs, runs for two hours, then leaves fo",
