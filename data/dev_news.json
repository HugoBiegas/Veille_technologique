Today, we'll discuss one of the frequently asked questions — and that is: can bounds be less than frame and can frame be less than bounds?

Gox一夜崩塌，4.5亿美元用户资金灰飞烟灭。2022年，FTX轰然倒下，数十亿美元打了水漂。这些虽然是交易所，但道理是一样的：把钱交给别人保管，你永远不知道明天会发生什么。 这篇文章换个角度。我们不堆参数，而是帮你搞清楚真正的风险在哪，为什么稳定币对商家来说是真香，以及不同类型的生意该选什么网关。 先搞懂最关键的问题 托管 vs 非托管：这到底意味着什么？ 每个加密支付网关，本质上只有两种模式。搞清楚这个区别，可能帮你避开大坑。 托管型网关会帮你\"保管\"资金。客户付款后，钱先进网关的钱包，你想用的时候再提出来——前提是他们让你提。 这就像把钱存银行。方便是方便，但银行要是出问题——倒闭、被黑、冻结你的账户——你的钱就卡住了。 非托管型网关完全不碰你的钱。客户付款，钱直接进你自己的钱包。网关只是帮你处理交易流程。 这就像一台直连你保险箱的收银机。收银员帮你收钱，但钱落到的是你",
