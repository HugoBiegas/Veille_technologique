Inspired by the Frankenstein metaphor, FrankenAgent Lab turns AI agent building into an act of assembly. Instead of stitching code together, you snap modular “body parts” into place. The",

To them DRY means: never repeat a line of code never have two components share similar structure never write anything twice If something looks similar, they feel obligated to merge it, abstract it, or build a “super component” with flags and conditions. Of course, the result is always the same: Overcomplicated, brittle, unreadable code that was technically DRY — and practically unu",
