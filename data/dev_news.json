That’s where @Async in Spring Boot comes to the rescue. In simple terms, @Async lets Spring say: “You go ahead, I’ll handle this task in the background.” Behind this simple annotation, Spring Boot uses proxies, thread pools, and executors to run your co",

The biggest breaking change was async route params, but with a phased approach and automation, we completed the migration in ~2 weeks with minimal production risk.

I investigated the 2D spatial recognition ability of a local LLM (gpt-oss:20b) using mazes as the subject.
