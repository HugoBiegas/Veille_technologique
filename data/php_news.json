One good example is having to choose between readonly properties or properties that are privately writeable. I'll show you why. Readonly properties were added in PHP 8.1. They allow a property to be set only once, and never change afterwards: final class Book { public function __construct( public readonly string $title, ) {} } $book = new Book('Timeline Taxi'); $book->title = 'Timeline Taxi 2'; Canno",
