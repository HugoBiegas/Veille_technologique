      "description": "Introduction Some time in 2024, during a Project Zero team discussion, we were talking about how remote ASLR leaks would be helpful or necessary for exploiting some types of memory corruption bugs, specifically in the context of Apple devices. Coming from the angle of “where would be a good first place to look for a remote ASLR leak”, this led to the discovery of a trick that could potentially be used to leak a pointer remotely, without any memory safety violations or timing attacks, in scenario",
