Microsoft said the update issued last week on November Patch Tuesday — KB5068781 for Windows 10 22H2 builds 19044.6575 and 19045.6575 — might fail to install on some commercial Windows 10 devices enrolled to receive Extended Security Updates (ESU). When attempts are made to install this patch, screens may show “error 0x800f0922 (CBS_E_INSTALLERS_FAILED). “",

      "description": "In cybersecurity, time is scarce, talent is scarce, and certainty is scarce. That’s why efficiency has quietly become the most valuable currency inside the security operations center (SOC). Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) research found that 53% of organizations say network detection and response (NDR) has helped improve SOC analyst efficiency. That might sound like a soft metric, until you consider the reality facing most teams: a global cybersecurity skills shortage, unrelenting alert volume, ",

      "description": "Posted by Jann Horn, Google Project ZeroIntroduction In early June, I was reviewing a new Linux kernel feature when I learned about the MSG_OOB feature supported by stream-oriented UNIX domain sockets. I reviewed the implementation of MSG_OOB, and discovered a security bug (CVE-2025-38236) affecting Linux >=6.9. I reported the bug to Linux, and it got fixed. Interestingly, while the MSG_OOB feature is not used by Chrome, it was exposed in the Chrome renderer sandbox. (Since then, sending MSG_OOB",

Experts say while the proposed ban may have more to do with TP-Link's ties to China than any specific technical threats, much of the rest of the industry serving this market also sources hardware from China and ships products that are insecure fresh out of the box.",
