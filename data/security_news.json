      "description": "Microsoft this week pushed security updates to fix more than 60 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and supported software, including at least one zero-day bug that is already being exploited. Microsoft also fixed a glitch that prevented some Windows 10 users from taking advantage of an extra year of security updates, which is nice because the zero-day flaw and other critical weaknesses patched today affect all versions of Windows, including Windows 10.",

      "description": "Posted by Mateusz Jurczyk, Google Project Zero In the previous blog post, we focused on the general security analysis of the registry and how to effectively approach finding vulnerabilities in it. Here, we will direct our attention to the exploitation of hive-based memory corruption bugs, i.e., those that allow an attacker to overwrite data within an active hive mapping in memory. This is a class of issues characteristic of the Windows registry, but universal enough that the techniques described",
