In their latest move, those behind the Sneaky2FA phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) kit have added browser-in-the-browser (BITB) functionality to help crooks design phishing pages that fool victims. This function allows the crook to embed a browser window on the victim’s desktop containing a phishing page that includes a URL address",

I reviewed the implementation of MSG_OOB, and discovered a security bug (CVE-2025-38236) affecting Linux >=6.9. I reported the bug to Linux, and it got fixed. Interestingly, while the MSG_OOB feature is not used by Chrome, it was exposed in the Chrome renderer sandbox. (Since then, sending MSG_OOB",
