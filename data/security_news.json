The rise of computer-using agents (CUAs) will accelerate attackers’ ability to automate and scale phishing and credential-stuffing attacks with minimal effort. As a result, adopting phishing-resistant credentials has shifted from best practice to a necessity. Organizations must prioritize device-bound ",

I reviewed the implementation of MSG_OOB, and discovered a security bug (CVE-2025-38236) affecting Linux >=6.9. I reported the bug to Linux, and it got fixed. Interestingly, while the MSG_OOB feature is not used by Chrome, it was exposed in the Chrome renderer sandbox. (Since then, sending MSG_OOB",
