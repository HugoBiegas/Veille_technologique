      "description": "Posted by Tim Willis, Google Project Zero In 2021, we updated our vulnerability disclosure policy to the current \"90+30\" model. Our goals were to drive faster yet thorough patch development, and improve patch adoption. While we&rsquo;ve seen progress, a significant challenge remains: the time it takes for a fix to actually reach an end-user's device.This delay, often called the \"patch gap,\" is a complex problem. Many consider the patch gap to be the time between a fix being released for a securi",
