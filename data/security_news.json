I reviewed the implementation of MSG_OOB, and discovered a security bug (CVE-2025-38236) affecting Linux >=6.9. I reported the bug to Linux, and it got fixed. Interestingly, while the MSG_OOB feature is not used by Chrome, it was exposed in the Chrome renderer sandbox. (Since then, sending MSG_OOB",
