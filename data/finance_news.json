Despite short-term weakness, several analysts suggest that ETH may be entering a bullish accumulation phase, with price action stabilizing around the key $4,000 level—a zone that has historically served as both strong resistance and support. The asset’s resilience amid market uncertainty reflects growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals and network activity. ",
