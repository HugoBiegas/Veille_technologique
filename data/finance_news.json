      "description": "加密貨幣市場的快速進化雖然帶來了財富契機，卻也伴隨著日新月異的犯罪手法。近期一起令全球幣圈震驚的「地址投毒（Address Poisoning）」攻擊事件，讓一名經驗豐富的資深交易員在轉瞬間失去了近 5,000 萬美元的 USDT。這起天價被盜案不僅揭露了駭客對心理學與區塊鏈技術的精準操控，更為所有投資者敲響了資安警鐘：在追求收益的道路上，哪怕是幾秒鐘的核對疏忽，都可能導致資產徹底清零。 致命的「相似性」：拆解地址投毒的心理陷阱 地址投毒並非傳統意義上的技術暴力破解，而是一種針對人類視覺慣性設計的進階釣魚手法。駭客首先會透過鏈上數據監控目標巨鯨的日常往來對象，隨後利用地址生成工具製造出一個與受害者常用地址極其相似的「假地址」——其開頭與結尾的幾個字元完全一致，僅有中間部分不同。 為了讓這個假地址滲透進受害者的交易視野，駭客會主動發送一筆小額或零價值的交易。這項舉動的目的在於讓假地址自動進入錢包的「最近交易記錄」。當受害者下次準備進行大額轉帳時，若習慣性地從歷史記錄中複製地址，且僅核對首尾幾位數，便會落入駭客預設的陷阱。這起損失 5,000 萬美元的案件中，受害者正是因為過度信任錢包記錄",
