Research shows that LLMs struggle with \"lost in the middle\" failures—forgetting tasks buried in long contexts. When your agent juggles file edits, test execution, and documentation updates, important steps can silently disappear. One solution, inspired by Claude Code, is to make planning explicit and observable with the help of a dedicated TodoWrite too",

In the past, I would have spent hours reading the reference documentation or tried to find tutorials which explain how I can write the code (or configuration) I need. Nowadays, I just start a new discussion with an AI chatbot and let the conversation evolve into a working code (or configuration).
