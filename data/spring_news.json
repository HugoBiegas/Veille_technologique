      "description": "This is a new blog post in the Road to GA series, this time updating everyone on the plans to integrate Spring gRPC with Spring Boot 4. The original plan was to move the autoconfiguration from Spring gRPC into Spring Boot in time for the 4.0 release. Unfortunately we haven't been able to find the time to merge that change, but the good news is that we have instead added support for Spring Boot 4 to the existing Spring gRPC project, and are planning a 1.0 release in the coming days.

While it&#8217;s very common to use the @DataJpaTest annotation when implementing integration tests, in this blog post, you will see why you are better off avoiding using this annotation. Why I don&#8217;t use @DataJpaTest As explained by the manual, Spring Boot provides the @DataJpaTest annotation for Spring Data JPA integration testing. Once the @DataJpaTest annotation ",

      "description": "Introduction In this article, I&#8217;m going to explain you should use compact table columns when designing your database schema. By using compact table columns, you can cache more table records and index entries and, therefore, speed up your SQL queries. Database caching As I explained in this article, relational database systems cache the pages that are loaded from the disk in the Buffer Pool (e.g., shared buffers in PostgreSQL) so that the next time the same page is requested by an SQL query",
