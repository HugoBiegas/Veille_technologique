AI introduces many new terms, acronyms, and techniques you must understand to build a good AI-based system. That makes it hard for many Java developers to learn how to integrate AI into their applications using SpringAI, Langchain4J, or some other library. I ran into the same issue when I started learning about AI. In this... The post AI Glossary for Java Developers appeared first on Thorben Janssen.",
